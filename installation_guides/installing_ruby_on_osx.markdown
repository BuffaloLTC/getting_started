# Install Ruby on OSX

Thanks to the open-source community, installing Ruby on OSX is a breeze. These
instructions will walk you through the process of installing the latest version
of Ruby so that you can begin coding right away!

We'll be using the command line quite a bit. If this sounds intimidating, check
out our [command line primer](https://github.com/BuffaloLTC/getting_started/wiki/Command-Line-primer)
beforehand.

## Installing a "C" Compiler

Before we can install any other tools, we'll need a compiler to create them.
[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is Apple's development environment
for OSX and iOS and includes the LLVM C compiler (Ruby is written in C). If you
want the full Xcode, it can be easily installed through the
[App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12).

For Ruby, however, we can alternatively install only the command-line tools,
which are hidden in Apple's obscure
[developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/). Visit the link, and
if needed, create an Apple ID (it's free). From the list of downloads, find the
Command Line Tools...

...click the icon to download, find the package on your Mac (likely the
`~/Downloads` directory), and double-click to install.

## Installing a Package Manager

Working with Ruby and the command-line is greatly streamlined through the use
of a package manager. A package manager handles all of the hard work of keeping
programs (packages) up-to-date, insuring they have all of the needed files
(dependancies), and installing the programs (compiling the packages from the
source code) onto your computer. In fact, the App Store is a sort of package
manager, though not free or open-source.

Our package manager of choice is [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).
To install, read through the [Homebrew introduction](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
for a quick overview of Homebrew, and then follow the instructions listed under
"Install Homebrew" at the bottom of the page.

If you haven't yet, open a new Terminal window, paste in the command from the
[Homebrew instructions](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), and follow the
printed instructions. You now have a package manager with access to thousands
of open-source command-line tools. Type `brew` into the Terminal for an idea of
what can be done with this package manager.

## Installing Version Control

Though not strictly necessary for programming, it's generally considered a bad
idea to program without some sort of version control. If you're not certain
what that is, check out CodeSchool's [Git primer](http://try.github.com/)
beforehand.

With our newfound package manager, installing Git is a breeze. Simply enter
`brew install git` into the Terminal and watch as it compiles. After completion,
enter `git` into the terminal for list of the most often-used Git commands.

## Installing Ruby

Finally, we're ready to install Ruby... almost. Ruby exists in many versions;
the version is indicated by three numbers separated by periods. To see the
current version, visit the [official Ruby site](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).
At the time of writing, 1.9.3-p374 is the latest Ruby version. Once a project
is begun in a particular version, you'll rarely want to change it without
extensive testing to ensure your program behaves the save. For this reason, it
is common to use a version manager to automatically switch between Rubies
depending on the current project.

Our version manager of choice is [Rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)
(short for RuBy ENVironment). To install Rbenv, enter `brew install rbenv
ruby-build` into the Terminal. These two tools, combined, make installing and
managing Ruby versions a breeze. For a list of Rbenv's most useful commands,
enter 'rbenv' and 'ruby-build' into the Terminal.

We're not done yet, though. Rbenv requires
[some special attention](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#installation)
from us to function properly. Follow
[Rbenv installation instructions](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#installation)
1-4 to ensure Rbenv can be accessed by the system.

Now, we can install Ruby! First, enter `ruby-build --definitions` into the
terminal for a list of the supported Ruby versions. Currently, we want the
latest patch-level release of Ruby 1.9.3, which the ruby-build says is
1.9.3-p374. To install, then, enter into the Terminal `rbenv install
1.9.3-p374`. Ruby has begun installing!

Once complete, we need to make sure Rbenv knows about our install. To do so,
enter `rbenv rehash` into the Terminal. Once complete, enter `rbenv versions`;
we should see our version of Ruby listed. We want to make this version of Ruby
available to the entire system, so that the much-older version of Ruby packaged
with OSX isn't invoked. To do so, enter `rbenv global 1.9.3-p374` into the
Terminal. This version of Ruby should now be available to the entire system. To
test, enter `ruby --version` into the Terminal. If the version displayed matches
the version installed, congratulationsâ€” you now have the latest version of Ruby 
installed on your Mac.
