# Setting Sublime Text preferences

Many programming languages have a suggested styling for their respective
syntaxes. Though not strictly necessary, these serve to make code easily
distinguishable and readable. To match Sublime to the suggested Ruby style,
find your user-specific preferences...

![User-specific preferences in Sublime Text](https://raw.github.com/BuffaloLTC/getting_started/master/images/sublime_preferences.jpg)

...and paste in the following lines:

```json
{
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
}
```

This sets the "soft tabs" (spaces instead of tabsâ€” a standard for all languages)
to two spaces wide. Check out an [extensive style guide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby)
if you're curious (don't worry if you don't understand all/any of it; even
seeing how other code looks like can be helpful!)
