## Welcome to Buffalo Learn To Program!

Here's what you need to get started:

### Ruby

We're using Ruby version 1.9.3.  The easiest way to install this is using
[RVM](https://rvm.io/). But we have more detailed installation instructions here:

* OS X: [Installing Ruby on OS X](https://github.com/BuffaloLTC/getting_started/wiki/Installing-Ruby-on-OSX)
* Windows: [Installing Ruby on Windows](https://github.com/BuffaloLTC/getting_started/wiki/Installing-Ruby-on-Windows)
* Linux: [Installing Ruby on Debian](https://github.com/BuffaloLTC/getting_started/wiki/Installing-Ruby-on-Linux-(Debian)

(some of these are still being written)

### Text Editor

We're using [Sublime Text for a text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/).
This uses color to make reading code easier, and has all sorts of useful
shortcuts to make writing coding easier, too.

Be sure to [match your settings](https://github.com/BuffaloLTC/getting_started/wiki/Sublime-Text-preferences)
to the Ruby standard!

###  Version Control

We're using [git for version control](http://git-scm.com/).  This allows us to
keep track of several versions of our files, so we can make and undo changes
without fear.

You're also going to need an account here on github. You can
[sign up for one](https://github.com/users) and you will need to follow the
instructions at [setting up git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
to set up git to work with your github account.

To try out git and get some experience with it, go to
[Try git](http://try.github.com/levels/1/challenges/1) and you'll find an
interactive tutorial that will teach you how to use git.

###  Communication

We're going to use IRC for communication.  It's a chat client that has been
around for a while, and it's easy to set up and use.  We're going to create our
own custom room to use, but first you need to download a IRC chat client.

* OS X: [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/)
* On the web: [Freenode web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/)

Once you have it installed and running, go to the IRC server irc.freenode.net,
and go to the room #BuffaloLTC

## Now that you've got everything set up...

We're using Chris Pine's Learn to Program as a textbook for this course. It's
available [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Program-Second-Edition-Facets-Series/dp/1934356360)
or [on the web](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram).
